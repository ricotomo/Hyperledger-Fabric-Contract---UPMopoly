# Hyperledger-Fabric-Contract---UPMopoly
UPM Blockchain for Financial Services final implementing monopoly via a smart contract on hyperledger fabric. 

In the course “Blockchain and Services for Fintech Enterprise Integration” we have examined various data security techniques, enterprise integration architecturures, and blockchain technologies. The course culminated in implementing a game “UPMopoly” using Hyperledger infrastructure and a smart contract. UPMopoly is a simplified version of the board game Monopoly where players must buy, sell and pay rent on faculties (as opposed to properties). The blockchain system is used to account for ownership and keep track of finances.
